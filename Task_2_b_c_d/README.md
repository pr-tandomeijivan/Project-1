# Instructions:

Add the mnist folder provided on ilias (in mnist-png-format) to the datasets folder

To run the different tasks just navigate to the Task_2_b_c_d folder and execute the following commands:
## Task 2b
```
./task_2_b.sh
```
the output can be found in the output/mlp folder

Results on Tensorboard (Visualization): 
```
tensorboard --logdir output/mlp --port 9009
```


## Task 2c
```
./task_2_c.sh
```
the output can be found in the output/cnn folder

Results on Tensorboard (Visualization): 
```
tensorboard --logdir output/cnn --port 9009
```

(Other outputs with different learning rate and epoch values from us are also available in the output folder and the plots can be seen on the tensorboard)

# DeepDIVA: A Highly-Functional Python Framework for Reproducible Experiments

DeepDIVA is an infrastructure designed to enable quick and intuitive
setup of reproducible experiments with a large range of useful analysis
functionality.
Reproducing scientific results can be a frustrating experience, not only
in document image analysis but in machine learning in general.
Using DeepDIVA a researcher can either reproduce a given experiment with
a very limited amount of information or share their own experiments with
others.
Moreover, the framework offers a large range of functions, such as
boilerplate code, keeping track of experiments, hyper-parameter
optimization, and visualization of data and results.
DeepDIVA is implemented in Python and uses the deep learning framework
[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/).
It is completely open source and accessible as Web Service through
[DIVAServices](http://divaservices.unifr.ch).

- [Tutorials](https://diva-dia.github.io/DeepDIVAweb/articles.html)
- [Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00329) 

## Getting started

In order to get the framework up and running it is only necessary to clone the latest version of the repository:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/DIVA-DIA/DeepDIVA.git
```

Run the script:

``` shell
bash setup_environment.sh
```

Reload your environment variables from `.bashrc` with: `source ~/.bashrc`

## Verifying Everything Works

To verify the correctness of the procecdure you can run a small experiment. Activate the DeepDIVA python environment:

``` shell
source activate deepdiva
```

Download the MNIST dataset:

``` shell
python util/data/get_a_dataset.py mnist --output-folder toy_dataset
```

Train a simple Convolutional Neural Network on the MNIST dataset using the command:

``` shell
python template/RunMe.py --output-folder log --dataset-folder toy_dataset/MNIST --lr 0.1 --ignoregit --no-cuda
```
